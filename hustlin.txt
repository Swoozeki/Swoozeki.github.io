Welcome to the Let's start Hustlin' podcast. This is the first episode, of what I hope is a going 
to be a long on-going series. So, what is this podcast about, and why should I listen to it? 

This podcast, I'm aiming to attract people who're in similar situation to myself. Someone who hasn't 
achieved anything significant in life. Maybe, struggling financially as well. Very self-conscious. You know,
a social retard. So the main theme being here with everything involved is personal development. The key fact
here is that I'm also in the same boat as you. I have yet to figure it all out, to sort myself together. 
So, with this podcast, it's not just a I did, and you should too, but rather a I'm doing, and you should too.

So with that being said, let me give you a small introduction of myself. I am a 21 year old computer science
student. Been living in Canada for 8 years, and I'm from a lower-middle class family, like most immigrant families. So,
all in all, I have a very average lifestyle. However, I have lived a very unsatisfactory life, and it all
just boils down to my own life choices. Every single day, I wake up and decide to not do things. And every
night, I sleep beating myself up for it. So, I've said "enough to that, and let's get hustlin'"

Thank you so much for listening. Be sure to come back for Episode 2 soon
